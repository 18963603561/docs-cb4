  Groups

 <shortdesc>
  Individual server-nodes can be assigned to specific <i>groups</i>, within
  a Couchbase Cluster. This allows <i>active</i> vBuckets to be maintained on a different group
  from that of their corresponding <i>replica</i> vBuckets; so that even
  if one group goes offline, bucket-data remains available on another group.

    Understanding Groups

   <p>
    <i>Groups</i> provide enhanced availability: each group can be established by the administrator
    to contain a number of nodes within a given Couchbase Cluster. One rebalance occurs, the active
    and replica vBuckets for a defined bucket are maintained on separate groups: in consequence, if an
    entire group goes offline, bucket-data remains available on another group. Rebalance ensures that
    vBuckets are distributed evenly across the nodes of defined groups: but if an imbalance occurs, whereby
    groups have unequal numbers of nodes, a <i>best effort</i> redistribution of replica vBuckets occurs
    across the cluster.

    vBucket Distribution Across Groups

   <p>
    The following illustration shows how vBuckets, active and replica, are distributed across multiple
    defined groups; in the recommended case, where groups contain equal numbers of nodes.
